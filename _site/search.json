    "text": "Executive Summary\n\nBased on my conversation with MeLive Team from MeTub, I understand that MeLive is currently facing significant challenges in the realm of TikTok advertising, particularly in the planning and optimization of their advertising budget. The current process lacks the required smoothness, leading to operational inefficiencies and hindering the overall effectiveness of their marketing endeavors.\n\n\nClient’s Problem\n\n\nIssued Identified:\n\n\nFragmented Data: Disparate data sources hinder comprehensive insights and accurate budgeting.\nTikTok Reliance: Overdependence on TikTok data without cross-verification leads to potential discrepancies.\nUncertain Metrics: Lack of clarity on whether metrics accurately reflect campaign effectiveness makes informed decisions difficult.\n\nCost Optimization: No clear assurance of efficient ad spending, hindering scaling potential.\n\n\nImpact on Business:\n\nThese challenges collectively impact the overall efficiency of advertising efforts on TikTok, potentially resulting in suboptimal resource allocation, missed opportunities, and an inability to accurately gauge the return on investment (ROI) from advertising expenditures.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nData Consolidation and Comprehensive Performance Report\n\n\nEnsure a seamless flow of information for comprehensive insights into current advertising budget allocation.\nBuild analysis and supporting reports to understand the current business performance\n\n\nDynamic Budget Allocation Algorithm\n\n\nDevelop a dynamic budget allocation algorithm that adjusts spending based on campaign performance."

Enhance Performance & Economics Visibility:\n\nImprove the understanding and visibility of performance metrics for each business model, including partner creator and full management creator\n\n2. Optimize Advertising Costs:\n\nImplement strategies to optimize advertising costs, including reducing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), maximizing Total Revenue, and maximizing Total Commission. The evaluation process will involve the assessment of three distinct scenarios to determine the most effective approach."

I will collaborate with MeLive to implement the ads allocation budget in March and April 2024 using the developed model. Post-revision and testing, if MeLive is satisfied with the outcomes, the transition to deploy the model within MeLive can be considered in the subsequent phase. This phased approach aims to save development resources for MeLive and ensures the model’s efficiency before it becomes an official feature."

This one-page debrief summarizes key insights. Dive into the full report for in-depth analysis (link in sidebar).\n\nMarket Overview\n\nVietnam’s e-commerce market is booming, surging 78% in 2023 to a staggering 225 trillion VND (9.2 billion USD).\nLive streaming is emerging as a key battleground, with TikTok Shop experiencing a meteoric rise (1355% growth) and capturing a significant 16% market share.\nFashion and Beauty & Personal Care dominate the landscape, but categories like Womenswear and Baby offer promising expansion opportunities for MeLive.\n\n\n\nMeLive Performance\n\nMeLive captured a 0.33% share of the total e-commerce market in H2 2023.\nWhile MeLive’s contribution currently represents 2.1% of TikTok’s revenue, its strong Q4 recovery (double-digit MoM growth) positions it to capitalize on TikTok’s market share decline.\nBeauty & Personal Care is MeLive’s strongest category (46%).\nPartner creators are the backbone, contributing 86.2% of Est. GMV.\nFull-management creators boast the highest NMV ratio and lowest cancellation rates, indicating untapped potential.\nAddress the lack of category diversification among top creators to encourage broader content reach.\n\n\n\nKey Recommendations\n\nCapture Market Share: Leverage Q4 momentum to capture a larger share of TikTok’s growing e-commerce market.\nWomenswear Expansion: Attract sellers and promote Womenswear, a high-growth category with low MeLive presence despite strong TikTok traction.\nOptimize Creator Mix: Analyze the high GMV generated by creators with no commission sharing to understand the feasibility of a revenue-sharing model for increased commission for MeLive.\nDevelop Full-Management Creators: Invest in strategies to refine skills and content focus of full-management creators to capitalize on their high potential for top performance and commission generation.\nEncourage Category Diversification: Implement strategies to encourage top creators to expand their content across categories, catering to a broader audience and potentially increasing NMV.\nExpand Seller Base: Develop strategies to attract and retain more sellers to keep pace with rising revenue.\nInvest in Video Content: Explore the expansion of video content creation due to its lower operational cost and potentially higher commission rates compared to livestreaming.\n\n\n\nData Improvement\n\nImprove Data Quality: Address data accuracy issues to ensure reliable insights for future decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

This translates to an increase in estimated revenue of 23.3% each month. However, Net Merchandise Value (NMV) only grew by 17.1% during the same period.

This translates to a commission rate of 2.2% on total revenue. However, the accuracy of these figures requires further verification due to potential data inconsistencies.\nThe average commission rate from brands was 9.8%. MeLive typically retains 27.2% of this commission, with the remaining portion shared with creators.\nOn average, a single livestream generated an estimated Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of 14 million VND, with a corresponding commission of approximately 312,000 VND. Again, these figures might be skewed by data inaccuracies.\n\nProduct Portfolio:\nIn H2 2023, MeLive’s product portfolio comprised roughly 19,334 products.
