# Market Overview

-   Vietnam's e-commerce market is booming, surging 78% in 2023 to a staggering 225 trillion VND (9.2 billion USD).
-   Live streaming is emerging as a key battleground, with TikTok Shop experiencing a meteoric rise (1355% growth) and capturing a significant 16% market share.

# MeLive Performance

-   While MeLive's contribution currently represents 2.1% of TikTok's revenue, its strong Q4 recovery (double-digit MoM growth) positions it to capitalize on TikTok's market share decline.
-   Beauty & Personal Care is MeLive's strongest category (46%).
-   Partner creators are the backbone, contributing 86.2% of Est. GMV.
